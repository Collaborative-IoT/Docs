# Authentication
Authentication for Collaborative-IoT is mainly done by using oauth from discord and github. Using pre-existing authentication systems grants many different benefits
that would take time to develop independently. 

Authentication can be configured by using the basic configuration file. We understand there may be people who chooses to host collaborative locally, 
in which using external authentication systems would be overkill, so we have an alternative that is configurable coming soon.
