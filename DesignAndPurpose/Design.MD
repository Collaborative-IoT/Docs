# The Design of Collaborative

Collaborative has a few different parts that make up the full platform:
-  [ControlServer](https://github.com/Collaborative-IoT/GeneralControlServer)
-  Interfaces([Web](https://github.com/Collaborative-IoT/Web-Frontend), [Desktop](https://github.com/Collaborative-IoT/Desktop-App), [Mobile](https://github.com/Collaborative-IoT/Mobile-App))
-  [VoiceServer](https://github.com/Collaborative-IoT/VoiceServer)
-  Postgres


## How does communication work?
Users can create "Rooms" and these rooms are the construct for all communication. Everyone in a specific room has their voice broadcasted to everyone else
same with text chat.
