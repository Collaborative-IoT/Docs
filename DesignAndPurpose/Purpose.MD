# The Purpose of Collaborative-Iot

Collaborative IoT is a platform built for collaboration on a collection of IoT devices. 
Using Collaborative Iot you can create a room with other peers and collectively control
devices.

# Why collaborate?

There are a ton of reasons why you would need to interact collectively with IoT projects. On top of being able to yield control of your devices to other
users in real-time, this platform is perfect for providing live demonstrations of a IoT platform or system. The live demonstrations are collaborative 
since there is built in real time voice/text communication in each "Control Room" on the platform.
